Motivation
----------
Changes some existing unit definitions and adds others to make
OpenMDAO more suitable to astrodynamics applications "out of the box."


Description
-----------

This POEM proposes the following changes:

* The astronomical unit abbreviation is changed from `ua` to the International
Astronomical Union (IAU) standard of `au`. [1]
* The definition of the astronomical unit is changed from `1.49597870691e11*m`
to the IAU standard of `1.49597870700e11*m` [1]
* The definition of light year is changed from `9.46073e15*m` to the IAU
definition of `c0*365.25*d` [2]
* The unit of parsec with abbreviation of `pc` is added with a definition
of `648000/pi*au` [3]
