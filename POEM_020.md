Motivation
==========

KSComp is generally used to add a quantity for constraint, similar to
EQConstraintComp.  This modification proposes adding a new option
`add_constraint` to automatically add this constraint during setup.


Description
===========

The following new options are added to KSComp to allow it to add
a constraint automatically during setup:

`add_constraint` - If True, add a constraint to the problem
`scaler` - Constraint scaler
`adder` - Constraint adder
`ref0` - Constraint zero reference
`ref` - Constraint unit reference
`parallel_deriv_color` - Constraint parallel deriv color
